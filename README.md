The directory structure you're seeing would go inside the app/src/ folder of an Android Studio project. To compile it:
1. Create a blank AndroidStudio project, "The Money Logs", to generate the relevant skeleton
2. Navigate to the app/src directory
3. Uncompress (if you downloaded an archive of this project) or git-clone (the repository URL) here
4. Compile and run on your Android device
